 *
 * A thread-directed signal must be consumed by the target thread only, not by
 * whichever thread reaches a delivery point first. Regression test for the bug
 * where sc_tgkill validated the target tid then dropped it into the single
 * process-wide pending set, so pthread_kill(worker, SIGUSR1) could be handled
 * on the main thread while the worker slept on in a blocking read.
 *
 * Also checks the anti-coalescing property: N tgkills of the same standard
 * signal to N distinct threads deliver N times, once per target, instead of
 * collapsing into a single pending bit.
 *
 * Syscalls exercised: tgkill(131), rt_sigaction(134), gettid(178),
 *                     clone(220, via pthread_create)
