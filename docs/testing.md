# Building And Testing

This document describes the development toolchain, the main `make` targets, and
how the repository validation flow is structured.

## Build Requirements

Host build requirements:

- Apple Silicon macOS host
- macOS 13 or newer
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- `clang`
- `codesign`
- GNU `make`
- GNU `objcopy` or `llvm-objcopy`
- GNU coreutils
- Go, for the elfuse-oci OCI CLI
- `bash` 3.2+ (the version Apple ships as `/bin/bash`) is sufficient for
  the test harness; no Homebrew `bash` is required. See
  `tests/lib/bash-compat.sh` for the cross-version shims (a portable
  microsecond clock and the parallel-array lookup pattern that replaces
  associative arrays). When editing a shell script under `tests/` or
  `scripts/`, the conventions in that file's header are the source of
  truth: no `EPOCHREALTIME`, no `declare -A`, no `mapfile`, no
  `${var^^}` / `${var,,}` case-conversion, and guard any potentially
  empty array expansion with `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` so `set -u` does
  not trip on it.
- Hypervisor entitlement: `com.apple.security.hypervisor`

Guest test builds additionally require:

- An AArch64 Linux cross-compiler for C test programs
- An AArch64 bare-metal toolchain for the assembly smoke test

OCI interop checks additionally require `jq`. `crane`, `skopeo`, and `umoci`
are used when available by `make oci-interop`; CI installs them so cross-tool
layout parsing and registry-truth checks are hard gates there.

`elfuse-oci` uses the Go `go-containerregistry` library directly for pulling
images, selecting platforms, and maintaining the OCI image-layout store. The
`crane` CLI is only used here as an independent registry/layout checker, while
`umoci` is used to verify that another OCI implementation can parse the store;
neither tool is on the normal `elfuse-oci run` execution path.

For a full local `make oci-interop` run on macOS:

```sh
brew install jq skopeo umoci
go install github.com/google/go-containerregistry/cmd/crane@v0.21.7
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"
```

For a full local run on Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y jq skopeo
go install github.com/google/go-containerregistry/cmd/crane@v0.21.7
go install github.com/opencontainers/umoci/cmd/umoci@latest
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"
```

The toolchain defaults are defined in `mk/toolchain.mk`, but these variables
are intended to be overridden when needed:

- `CROSS_COMPILE`
- `BAREMETAL_CROSS`
- `SIGN_IDENTITY`

### Installing the toolchains with Homebrew

The following block installs everything needed to run both `make check` and
the full `make test-matrix` (including the `qemu-aarch64` reference run). Run it
once on an Apple Silicon macOS host:

```sh
# GNU coreutils (gtimeout) — required by the test harness timeout wrapper
brew install coreutils

# GNU objcopy
brew install binutils

# Bare-metal aarch64-none-elf toolchain used by `make check`
brew install --cask gcc-aarch64-embedded

# AArch64 Linux cross-compiler for guest test binaries (make test-matrix)
brew tap messense/macos-cross-toolchains
brew trust --formula messense/macos-cross-toolchains/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
brew install aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# QEMU — boots the Alpine minirootfs for the qemu-aarch64 reference run
brew install qemu
```

Depending on your setup, you might need to add the following to your PATH
```
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/aarch64-elf-gcc/bin:$PATH"
```

## Main Targets

The most useful development targets are:

```sh
make elfuse
make check
make test-rosetta-all
make test-gdbstub
make test-matrix
make elfuse-oci
make oci-test
make oci-lint
make oci-interop
make lint
make clean
```

What they do:

- `make elfuse`: build and sign `build/elfuse`
- `make check`: fast elfuse-internal gate. Runs, in order:
  - `scripts/check-syscall-coverage.py` so any new `dispatch.tbl`
    entry without a direct or aliased test reference fails the build
  - the unit suite from `tests/manifest.txt` -- deliberately narrow: only
    tests that assert elfuse-internal implementation details with no real
    Linux counterpart (the EL1 shim fast-path suite, `test-mremap-infra`,
    `test-oom-proc`), plus whatever `mk/tests.mk`'s `SANITIZER_SECTIONS`
    needs for the `check-{asan,ubsan,tsan}` lanes. Everything that is
    meaningful to cross-check against a real Linux kernel lives exclusively
    in `tests/test-matrix.sh`'s `run_unit_tests` instead (see Test Matrix
    below) -- `make check` alone is *not* a substitute for it
  - the TLBI RVAE1IS encoder unit test
  - the proctitle argv-tail and low-stack regressions
  - the BusyBox applet smoke suite (auto-resolved from
    `externals/test-fixtures/aarch64-musl/staticbin/bin/busybox` or
    downloaded into `build/busybox` on first run)
  - the sysroot procfs exec, FUSE-on-Alpine, and `timeout=0` regressions
  - the Rosetta CLI gating regressions
  - the hot-syscall guardrail (`tests/test-bench-guardrail.sh`)
    asserting `getpid`, libc `clock_gettime`, and 1-byte
    `/dev/urandom` reads stay under their ns/op ceilings
- `make test-rosetta-all`: Rosetta-specific x86_64 acceptance scripts
  (`test-rosetta-cli`, `test-rosetta-failure-modes`,
  `test-rosetta-statics`, `test-rosetta-alpine`,
  `test-rosetta-audit`, `test-rosetta-jit`, `test-rosetta-glibc`)
- `make test-busybox`: just the BusyBox suite, useful when iterating on a
  single applet failure without rerunning the unit suite
- `make test-fuse-alpine`: validate guest `/dev/fuse` + `mount("fuse")`
  against the Alpine musl sysroot fixture
- `make test-gdbstub`: debugger integration checks against the built-in GDB stub
- `make test-matrix`: cross-check `elfuse` (aarch64), QEMU (aarch64),
  and `elfuse` (x86_64-via-Rosetta) on overlapping corpora
- `make elfuse-oci`: build the Go OCI image CLI
- `make oci-test`: run offline elfuse-oci tests
- `make oci-lint`: `gofmt` check plus `go vet` for elfuse-oci (vet runs for both
  `GOOS` values, so the darwin sparsebundle files are checked from Linux and the
  non-darwin stubs from macOS)
- `make oci-interop`: pull OCI fixtures, check the raw image-layout files with
  `jq`, and ask available external tools to read the same store
- `make lint`: static analysis through `clang-tidy`

## Quick Iteration

For normal code changes touching syscall or runtime logic:

```sh
make elfuse
make check
make test-matrix-elfuse-aarch64
```

`make check` alone only covers elfuse-internal plumbing and the sanitizer
subset now; `test-matrix-elfuse-aarch64` is what actually exercises the full
unit-test surface against `build/elfuse` (no qemu boot needed, so it is about
as fast to iterate with as `make check` was before the split). For changes
that touch procfs, path handling, `/dev`, FUSE, networking, dynamic linking,
or guest process semantics, also cross-check against the qemu reference
kernel:

```sh
make test-matrix-qemu-aarch64
```

or run all matrix modes back-to-back with `make test-matrix`.

`make check` already runs the BusyBox applet suite as a second stage, so a
green `make check` covers BusyBox validation. Use `make test-busybox` to
iterate on a single applet failure without rerunning the unit suite.

### OCI Image CLI

The OCI image CLI (`build/elfuse-oci`) is pure Go, so most of it builds and tests
without Hypervisor.framework; only an actual `elfuse-oci run` guest boot needs
HVF. For elfuse-oci changes:

```sh
make elfuse-oci                # build
make oci-test                        # offline unit + conformance tests
make oci-lint                        # gofmt check + go vet (both GOOS values)
ELFUSE_OCI_NETTEST=1 make oci-test   # add the registry pull round-trip
make oci-interop                     # image-layout + cross-tool interop (needs jq)
```

`make oci-interop` always requires `jq`; install `crane`, `skopeo`, and `umoci`
too when you want the local run to match the CI cross-tool gate. The Darwin
sparsebundle round-trip (real `hdiutil` + case-sensitive APFS) is gated behind an
env var and runs only on macOS:

```sh
ELFUSE_OCI_DARWIN_CS=1 go test -run TestDarwinCSSweep ./cmd/elfuse-oci/
```

CI splits this coverage by what each runner can do:

- **Linux (hosted)**: build, `gofmt`/`go vet` (including a `GOOS=darwin`
  cross-vet of the sparsebundle files), the pull/inspect/unpack/list/rmi/prune
  lifecycle, the `ELFUSE_OCI_NETTEST` round-trip, and crane/skopeo/umoci interop.
  The unit suite runs with `-race` here.
- **macOS (hosted)**: build plus the full `go test -race` on darwin (exercising
  the sparsebundle/clone code the Linux job can only cross-vet). The darwin
  concurrency-sensitive code (cache sweep, provision, clone, cache-removal lock
  discipline) compiles only on darwin, so this is the only place the race
  detector ever sees it; keep `-race` on this step. Plus the real
  `ELFUSE_OCI_DARWIN_CS` sparsebundle round-trip, and a run-less
  pull/inspect/list/rmi/prune lifecycle smoke through the darwin binary.
  No HVF needed.

### Writing OCI unit-test fixtures

An image is untrusted input: its layers control file *names and shapes*, not
just contents. When testing unpack, cache, or sweep code, build fixtures that
adversarially exercise those, not only escape-by-content:

- **Reserved marker names.** An image can ship a path that collides with an
  elfuse-managed marker (e.g. a layer with `/.elfuse-keep`). Assert the marker
  is ignored when it comes from image content and honored only when
  elfuse-oci wrote it out of band (see
  `TestListSweepableClonesReapsImageShippedKeepFile`).
- **Implicit directories.** A layer may create `dir/sub/file` with no `dir/sub`
  tar entry. Whiteout/opaque logic must treat that implicit parent as
  current-layer content (see `TestUnpackOpaqueAfterImplicitParentChildren`).
- **Platform variants.** Set `cfg.Variant` (e.g. `linux/arm/v7`) so `inspect`
  and `list` are checked to agree, not just os/arch.
- **Concurrency.** Use the package-level function-var seams (`afterImageResolve`,
  `cranePull`, `isMountPointFn`, ...) to stage a racing pull/rmi in the exact
  TOCTOU window rather than only single-command paths, and hold the store or
  cache flocks directly to assert a busy path refuses.
- **macOS + HVF (self-hosted)**: end-to-end `elfuse-oci run` guest boots:
  the alpine:3 default-entrypoint smoke that proves pull → sparsebundle →
  COW clone → HVF launch → exit-code propagation, and a full
  pull → inspect → list → run → rmi → prune lifecycle that runs
  python:3.12-slim with an `--entrypoint` override and asserts both teardowns
  (a plain rmi reclaiming the cold cache with the image, then a `run --keep`
  cache that rmi refuses without `--force` and `--force` detaches and drops).

## Test Matrix

The matrix driver lives in `tests/test-matrix.sh`. It currently covers three
execution modes:

- `elfuse-aarch64`: every binary is executed via `build/elfuse` on macOS
- `qemu-aarch64`: the same binaries run natively inside an Alpine
  `aarch64-linux-musl` minirootfs booted by `qemu-system-aarch64`
- `elfuse-x86_64`: Rosetta-for-Linux acceptance scripts against the staged
  Alpine x86_64 fixture tree

The goal is not to compare performance. The goal is to compare guest-observable
behavior against a ground-truth Linux AArch64 environment so that any divergence
in syscall translation, procfs emulation, or process semantics is caught early.

`run_unit_tests` in `tests/test-matrix.sh` is the full aarch64 unit-test
surface -- every binary that is meaningful to run against a real kernel, which
is almost everything. It deliberately excludes only the handful of tests that
assert elfuse-internal implementation details with no meaningful counterpart
on a real kernel (the EL1 shim fast-path suite, `test-mremap-infra`,
`test-oom-proc` -- these live solely in `tests/manifest.txt` / `make check`,
see that file's header for the full split rationale). There is no separate
"core" vs "extended" test set inside the matrix; a test that has a real,
understood divergence from the qemu reference kernel is listed in
`QEMU_SKIP` with a comment explaining why instead -- see that variable in
`tests/test-matrix.sh` for the current list and rationale. `run_unit_tests`
runs in both `elfuse-aarch64` and `qemu-aarch64` modes, so most tests are
exercised twice per matrix run: once against `build/elfuse`, once against the
real kernel.

The x86_64 mode is narrower: it aggregates the Rosetta-specific acceptance
scripts and their per-binary summaries into the same matrix runner, including
the Rosetta thread/signal audit smoke, the LuaJIT guest-JIT probe, and the
glibc dynamic-binary acceptance helper.

Run a single mode with `bash tests/test-matrix.sh elfuse-aarch64`,
`bash tests/test-matrix.sh qemu-aarch64`, or
`bash tests/test-matrix.sh elfuse-x86_64`; `all` runs all three back-to-back.

Fixture handling is self-contained:

- On first use, `tests/fetch-fixtures.sh` downloads the required Alpine
  packages and the `linux-virt` kernel into `externals/test-fixtures/` and
  assembles an initramfs. Subsequent runs are zero-config.
- The same fixture tree is reused across the matrix modes.
- When Rosetta mode is requested and the translator is installed,
  `tests/test-matrix.sh` auto-fetches the x86_64 fixture tree
  (`INCLUDE_X86_64=1`) on demand.
- QEMU mode requires `qemu-system-aarch64` on `PATH` (Homebrew `qemu` provides it).
- musl is the only Alpine libc; the glibc-dynamic suite is skipped unless
  `GUEST_GLIBC_*` environment variables point at an external sysroot.

## Rosetta Limitations

`elfuse-x86_64` is expected to inherit two Rosetta-internal limitations that are
not treated as elfuse regressions:

- `SA_RESETHAND` is not reset reliably because Rosetta shadows guest signal
  handler state internally.
- `clone(..., CLONE_SETTLS, tls=0, ...)` can hang.

The x86_64 matrix branch is therefore a Rosetta acceptance gate, not a claim
that translated guests fully match native Linux thread and signal semantics.

## x86_64 Acceptance Inventory and Per-Host Baselines

The `elfuse-x86_64` matrix mode aggregates seven sub-suites. Each one
emits a deterministic per-binary pass list; the matrix runner sums
those into a single `Results:` line and compares against a per-host
baseline. The exact labels each sub-suite emits, and the contract
they verify, are:

- `tests/test-rosetta-cli.sh` (4): `rosetta-disabled-flag`,
  `rosetta-disabled-env`, `rosetta-gdb`, `rosetta-default` --
  command-line gating of the translator path (opt-out flag, env
  override, `--gdb` rejection, install-hint surface).

- `tests/test-rosetta-failure-modes.sh` (3): `no-rosetta-flag`,
  `no-rosetta-env`, `gdb-x86_64` -- command-line rejection paths.
  Self-contained against a synthesized minimal x86_64 ELF; no
  external fixture tree required. The dynamic-linker bring-up and
  mid-process execve scenarios that used to live here are now
  exclusively in the glibc and statics suites against the vendored
  rootfs (see `glibc-hello` / `glibc-hello-via-ldso` and
  `env-execve`).

- `tests/test-rosetta-statics.sh` (20): `echo`, `true`, `false`,
  `printenv`, `expr-zero`, `expr-mul`, `basename`, `dirname`,
  `stat-self`, `factor`, `seq`, `sha256sum`, `md5sum`, `uname-m`, `arch`,
  `busybox-arch-subcommand`, `date-utc`, `id-u`, `nproc`,
  `env-execve` -- statically-linked Alpine busybox applets,
  exercising VZ ioctl gate, `/proc/self/exe` redirect, high-VA mmap,
  and the kbuf alias.

- `tests/test-rosetta-alpine.sh` (33): `cat-fruits-first-line`,
  `wc-l-fruits`, `wc-l-lines`, `wc-c-lines`, `ls-data`, `stat-data`,
  `find-by-name`, `du-sk-data`, `sha256-fruits`,
  `sha256-lines-matches-host`, `sha512-lines`, `md5-fruits`,
  `cksum-fruits`, `sort-first`, `sort-reverse-first`, `pipe-sort-wc`,
  `pipe-tr-uppercase`, `pipe-cat-grep`, `pipe-sed-subst`,
  `pipe-awk-field`, `head-n3`, `tail-n3`, `pipe-sort-uniq`,
  `pipe-cut-field`, `pipe-rev`, `tac-reverse-first-line`, `seq-1-5`,
  `seq-step`, `factor-prime`, `factor-composite`, `diff-identical`,
  `diff-differs`, `pipe-base64-decode` -- broader file I/O, text
  processing, and host-shell pipelines stitched through Rosetta on
  every stage.

- `tests/test-rosetta-audit.sh` (2): `audit-known-limitations`,
  `tls0-known-hang` -- bookkeeping probe that asserts the documented
  Rosetta shadowing failures (above) remain the only divergences;
  fails loudly if a new threading/signal-state edge case starts
  diverging.

- `tests/test-rosetta-jit.sh` (2): `luajit-trace`,
  `luajit-coroutine` -- guest-side JIT under translation
  (LuaJIT trace emission + coroutine allocation), covering the
  small-mprotect RW->RX and per-thread icache observation path that
  rosetta's own JIT does not exercise.

- `tests/test-rosetta-glibc.sh` (7): `glibc-hello`,
  `glibc-hello-via-ldso`, `glibc-hello-list`, `glibc-dlopen`,
  `glibc-tls`, `glibc-gdtls`, `glibc-pthread-tls` --
  dynamically-linked glibc x86_64 binary acceptance through
  `--sysroot` against the staged minimal glibc rootfs under
  `externals/test-fixtures/x86_64-glibc/rootfs/`. The first three
  cover load-time `PT_INTERP` resolution and `ld.so --list`
  introspection. `glibc-dlopen` runs `dlopen("libm.so.6")` plus a
  `dlsym(sqrt)` round-trip to exercise the runtime fresh-`.so`-mmap
  codepath, which is distinct from the load-time path the first
  three probes touch. `glibc-tls` reads and writes two
  initial-exec `__thread` variables (one integer, one pointer) so a
  broken FS-register to `TPIDR_EL0` translation surfaces as a
  value mismatch rather than as a silent skip. `glibc-gdtls`
  `dlopen`s a companion `libgdtls.so` whose `__thread` variable
  must use the general-dynamic model (calls `__tls_get_addr`);
  this is the only probe that exercises that lowering path, which
  the initial-exec probe cannot reach. `glibc-pthread-tls`
  `pthread_create`s a worker thread that reads and writes its own
  `__thread` slot; the probe asserts the worker saw its own
  default value (not the main thread's overwritten marker) and that
  the main thread's slot survives the worker's write, so a broken
  per-thread `TPIDR_EL0` setup on additional threads surfaces as
  isolation failure rather than as a silent crash.

Total: 71 expected passes, 0 expected failures.

### Per-Host Baseline Capture

The matrix runner keys its `elfuse-x86_64` baseline by detected host
SoC class. Two classes matter because `sys_mmap_fixed_high_va` takes
different paths under different IPA widths:

- `apple-m1-m2`: 36-bit native IPA, exercises the overflow-segment
  path. Captured on this codebase against Apple M1 hardware
  (MacBookAir10,1). The seven sub-suites land at 71/0/0.

- `apple-m3-plus`: 40-bit native IPA, exercises the bisected-slab
  path (and the M5 slab-bisection variant). Currently held equal to
  `apple-m1-m2` pending operator capture on real M3+ hardware. When
  that capture lands, only the
  `"elfuse-x86_64:apple-m3-plus|<min_pass>|<max_fail>"` row in the
  `EXPECTED_BASELINES` array in `tests/test-matrix.sh` moves; the
  M1/M2 row stays intact.

- `apple-unknown`: fallback for SoC brand strings the detector does
  not recognise. Inherits the M1/M2 numbers and triggers a one-line
  warning so a new SoC does not silently graft onto an existing row.

Class detection reads `sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string` and matches
against `Apple M1`/`Apple M2` (M1/M2) and `Apple M3`/`Apple M4`/`Apple
M5` (M3+). To exercise the M3+ row from an M1/M2 host (and vice
versa) without changing the detector, set
`MATRIX_HOST_CLASS_OVERRIDE=apple-m3-plus` (or `apple-m1-m2`,
`apple-unknown`) before invoking `tests/test-matrix.sh`.

When the seven sub-suites grow or trim a test, the per-sub-suite
counts in the comment block above `EXPECTED_BASELINES` and the
inventory list above must move in the same commit so the per-host
baseline stays in sync with reality. Each `EXPECTED_BASELINES` entry
is a pipe-separated `mode-key|min_pass|max_fail` triple parsed by
`expected_baseline_get()` in `tests/test-matrix.sh`.

## Test Inventory

The repository contains several layers of validation:

- unit-style guest tests compiled from `tests/*.c`
- shell integration suites such as BusyBox, coreutils, and dynamic-loader tests
- debugger integration tests for the GDB stub
- native macOS HVF checks such as multi-vCPU and RWX validation

The quick suite is driven by `tests/driver.sh`, which supports:

- `-f PATTERN` to filter tests
- `-l` to list them
- `-T` for TAP output

Example:

```sh
bash tests/driver.sh -f test-proc
```

## Validation Strategy By Change Type

Suggested minimum validation:

| Change area | Recommended validation |
|-------------|------------------------|
| CLI, logging, docs-only build rules | `make elfuse` |
| OCI lifecycle or store behavior | `make oci-lint && make oci-test && make oci-interop` |
| General syscall or runtime logic | `make elfuse && make check && make test-matrix-elfuse-aarch64` |
| `/proc`, `/dev`, path, or BusyBox-sensitive behavior | `make elfuse && make check && make test-matrix-elfuse-aarch64` |
| Rosetta hosting, x86_64 dispatch, VZ ioctls, AOT cache | `make elfuse && make test-rosetta-all` |
| Broad behavioral changes | `make elfuse && make check && make test-matrix` |
| Debugger or ptrace flow | `make elfuse && make test-gdbstub` |
